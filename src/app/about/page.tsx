      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Why I Built It</h2>
      <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        WhyTMI started as a side project to sharpen my <span className="font-semibold">Next.js</span> and full-stack skills. 
        I wanted to challenge myself by building something real, and at the same time create a tool that can actually help people exchange knowledge.
